        <p class="lead" style="max-width: 70ch;">Grocery totals don’t translate cleanly into dinner. Here’s how to think about the real cost of a home‑cooked meal without turning your life into a spreadsheet.</p>

      <article class="about" style="margin-top: 18px;">
        
<p>Most of us know the feeling: you walk out of the store with two bags, you paid $128, and you’re thinking, “How is this even possible?”</p>
<p>The problem is that a grocery total isn’t a “meal” number. It’s a pile of ingredients that will get used across multiple days, multiple meals, and sometimes… not at all.</p>

<h2>Why your receipt total lies (kind of)</h2>
<p>Receipts are honest about what you paid, but they’re not honest about what you <em>ate</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You buy a full bottle of olive oil but use two tablespoons.</li>
  <li>You buy a big pack of chicken but freeze half.</li>
  <li>You buy produce with good intentions and then it quietly dies in the crisper drawer.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you try to answer “What did dinner cost?” using only the grocery total, you’ll always feel like your numbers are wrong.</p>

<h2>A simple way to estimate cost per meal</h2>
<p>If you want a quick, low-effort estimate, here’s the best “close enough” approach:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pick one dinner you cooked this week.</li>
  <li>List the main ingredients you used.</li>
  <li>For each one, estimate the portion you used (half the package, one quarter, etc.).</li>
  <li>Add those portions up.</li>
  <li>Divide by servings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is it perfect? No. But it’s real-world accurate in a way that “$128 groceries” is not.</p>

<h2>What usually moves the number the most</h2>
<p>In practice, a few categories swing the cost per meal more than everything else:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Protein</strong> (meat, fish, eggs, tofu): the big one.</li>
  <li><strong>Convenience</strong> (pre-cut, pre-made): you’re paying for time.</li>
  <li><strong>Waste</strong> (food not eaten): the silent budget killer.</li>
  <li><strong>Staples</strong> (oil, spices, sauces): “expensive” up front, cheap per use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why “it depends” is still useful</h2>
<p>People ask for a single number like it’s a fact. But cost per meal depends on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where you live</li>
  <li>How many people you’re feeding</li>
  <li>How often you use leftovers</li>
  <li>How much convenience you buy</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal isn’t to match someone else’s number. It’s to know <em>your</em> baseline, then notice when it changes.</p>

<h2>The practical takeaway</h2>
<p>If you do nothing else, do this: pick 5 meals you cook often and estimate their cost once. That alone will give you more clarity than a month of grocery totals.</p>
<p>And if you want the “no-drama” way to do it, logging receipts and building meals from real prices is the whole point of MealCost. Not perfection. Just clarity.</p>
