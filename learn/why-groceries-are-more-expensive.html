<p>If you’ve ever felt like you bought the same stuff and still paid more, you’re not imagining it.</p>

<h2>Three things are usually happening</h2>

<h3>1) Prices really did go up</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s as simple as that. A few items increase a little at a time, and your brain doesn’t track it well.</p>

<h3>2) Packages got smaller</h3>
<p>This is the annoying one. Same box, same price (or higher), less product. So your “per use” cost goes up even if you don’t notice at checkout.</p>

<h3>3) You swapped without realizing it</h3>
<p>Not even in a “bad” way. Just in a normal way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>different brand because the usual was out</li>
  <li>more convenience because you were busy</li>
  <li>more snacks because the kids found them</li>
</ul>
<p>Those little shifts add up fast.</p>

<h2>Why memory is a terrible tracker</h2>
<p>Humans are great at remembering feelings and terrible at remembering prices.</p>
<p>You’ll remember “that was expensive,” but not whether it was $4.49 or $6.29. That’s why price trends feel confusing without actual history.</p>

<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>The fastest way to reduce stress here is not “coupon harder.” It’s having simple visibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which items are climbing?</li>
  <li>How often are you buying them?</li>
  <li>Did your habits change, or did prices change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you can see that, you can make calm choices instead of reacting at the checkout line.</p>
